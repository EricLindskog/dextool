# Features
 - operators are translated to words. As it is now an operator would result in broken code.
 - Stub generation of C-functions.
 - Better control of nameing and prefixes. callback namespace, callback
   functions, data structure etc.

# Before it is useful
 - [DONE] Interface method that are const.
 - [DONE] const parameters in a method.
 - [DONE] Generated data in namespace to avoid name collisions.
 - [DONE] include original file in stub generated.
 - [DONE] generated .cpp must include generated .hpp.
 - user can supply their own Init-function of the stub by have a stub_classname_config.hpp in the same folder.
 - handle all operators.
 - Manager of lifetime for the stub and access to the instance for the tester.
 - ctor's. Problem is... a sensible name mangling.
   Hmm maybe have to use extern function pointers?
 - ctor's arguments must be stored.
 - default ctor must always be implemented.

# Quality of Life
 - Date in the header when it was generated.
 - Support for header with copyright notice in generated.
 - A pure stub interface that have all callbacks inherited. Both one with
   implementation and one without.

# Architecture
 - [WIP] Break up stub in submodules. Should increase maintainability and reusability.
 - Change AST traversal to strictly follow the Visitor pattern. The apply
   function should NOT take a cursor but rather an interface with all node
   types of interest. Descend variable is a bandaid and should thus be able to
   remove.
 - Split cpp.d method to a virtual\_method. It is confusing that the first
   parameter (boolean) determines if it is virtual. Better if the function name
   says it.
